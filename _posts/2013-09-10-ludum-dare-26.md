# First Timer

This was the entry for my first time participating in Ludum Dare. The theme was minimalism, which is perfect for me, as I’m certainly not an artist.

Instead of using the full 48 hours to develop the game, I spent only a few hours working on this right before the deadline. I wasn’t planning on entering. The only reason I changed my mind about it was because I was watching so many other developers make their games on twitch. Twitch gave me the itch. So I decided to make a simple platformer. The tower repeats forever - the platforms and coins are random.
# It’s Incomplete

There is no UI, death, or goal. The performance is a bit poor on older machines because of the dynamic lights, shadows, and SSAO. I wanted these effects for the look - but things could be highly optimized. Shadows could be baked. Things could be vertex lit.

The music was made with wolfram’s music generator, and sfxr was used to make the sound effects.

I think this is a game that I want to put more work into. I feel it would fit well on the OUYA with local multiplayer. Further inspiration comes from Tower of Greed and some various other games that involve climbing a tower or dying.
# Maybe more later

Future features might include a hookshot swing instead of a jetpack. The game was made in Unity. There’s nothing I can’t do with it.

The game is playable in the web browser. Source code and assets are available as per the Ludum Dare Compo rules.
# Play it!
