{% include youtube.html id="qHfz6rU4GYA" %}

Trent Sterling is my name. I am a game developer. I make games. I also play games. Sometimes I upload the results to youtube.

Here’s my 2nd Game Dev Vlog. Friend of mine is always looking for more streams/gamedev related content to watch, and I figure it’s time I give him something to watch.

I want to upload these often, but my internet is pretty awful. Even at 720p this video will take 2-3 hours to upload. Ouch.
