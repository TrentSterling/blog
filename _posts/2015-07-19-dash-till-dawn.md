*Dash Till Dawn* is a one-button endless runner game developed in collaboration with 2DGameDev (Dave) ([Twitch](http://www.twitch.tv/2dgamedev)).

In this project, Dave was responsible for the pixel art, while I handled the programming. The game features simple mechanics: press a button to jump and avoid obstacles. The goal is to keep running as far as possible, dodging cars, debris, and zombies, while avoiding falling off the screen.

The game is **released on [itch.io](https://trent.itch.io/dash-till-dawn)** but is not finished. While it’s technically playable, we’re still working on polishing it, adding menus, balancing the gameplay, and improving performance. The project, unfortunately, didn’t go as planned, and the development stalled out due to some complications along the way. But it's out there for anyone who wants to give it a try.

We used **Unity** for development, which worked well for the 2D mechanics and integrating the pixel art. The core gameplay is there, but there are still several things left to improve and finalize.

Here are some screenshots from the development process:

Just know that it’s still a work in progress, and we’re no longer actively developing it due to how things played out.
