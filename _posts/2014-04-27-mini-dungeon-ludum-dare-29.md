So me and Yuuki didn’t really want to kill our momentum, but I also thought it would be fun to give ourselves a little challenge.

Ludum Dare is a game competition / jam where developers spent 48 hours making a game. It’s obviously a bit short for anything polished, so you generally get a bunch of prototypes.

We decided to enter the jam, which has more relaxed rules. The theme is Beneath the Surface, which makes me think of digging games or perhaps something with a submarine.

We decided to twist the theme a bit, and decided that if we added a surface level as the tutorial, a mini dungeon game that goes 10 levels to hell would ‘fit’. We’re using a bunch of paid assets, which is the other reason we have to join the jam, and not the competition. The compo is open source, but the jam is relaxed about it.

We got gameplay stripped down to it’s most basic level. Our usual scope involves a ton of weapons, powers, attacks, animations, and blah blah blah. This game has to be mini, so we went for a bow and arrow as our main attack.

It can be varied with different arrows, and a multi-arrow upgrade, but these things are being ignored for now.

It’s up to Yuuki to come up with our level building blocks. Right now I’m using the floor and walls from our current **Blocky Dungeon** game, but I wan’t to change it as this mini-dungeon isn’t supposed to rip off our current game too much. (Yes, I’m aware its a blatant ripoff, I don’t care. Neither should you.)

Anyway, I haven’t even officially entered on the Ludum Dare website because we’re not super committed to it. Lots of little interruptions have slowed progress a bit, and I have a full day of errands planned tomorrow. If the game reaches a playable state, we’ll post it all over, but I’d prefer it reaches a ‘**fun**‘ state.<dl class='gallery-item col-3'><dt class='gallery-icon'>![thehorror](/assets/img/blog/wp/thehorror.jpg)</dt></dl><dl class='gallery-item col-3'><dt class='gallery-icon'>![mytoe](/assets/img/blog/wp/mytoe.jpg)</dt></dl><dl class='gallery-item col-3'><dt class='gallery-icon'>![manyspiders](/assets/img/blog/wp/manyspiders.jpg)</dt></dl><dl class='gallery-item col-3'><dt class='gallery-icon'>![spidersohgod](/assets/img/blog/wp/spidersohgod.jpg)</dt></dl><dl class='gallery-item col-3'><dt class='gallery-icon'>![ohgodthepain](/assets/img/blog/wp/ohgodthepain.jpg)</dt></dl><dl class='gallery-item col-3'><dt class='gallery-icon'>![owie](/assets/img/blog/wp/owie.jpg)</dt></dl><dl class='gallery-item col-3'><dt class='gallery-icon'>![aimbottingskellys](/assets/img/blog/wp/aimbottingskellys.jpg)</dt></dl><dl class='gallery-item col-3'><dt class='gallery-icon'>![skellyarrows](/assets/img/blog/wp/skellyarrows.jpg)</dt></dl><dl class='gallery-item col-3'><dt class='gallery-icon'>![watchthemouse](/assets/img/blog/wp/watchthemouse.gif)</dt></dl><dl class='gallery-item col-3'><dt class='gallery-icon'>![runningzomber](/assets/img/blog/wp/runningzomber.gif)</dt></dl><dl class='gallery-item col-3'><dt class='gallery-icon'>![IMG_26042014_175343](/assets/img/blog/wp/IMG_26042014_175343.png)</dt></dl><dl class='gallery-item col-3'><dt class='gallery-icon'>![IMG_26042014_173617](/assets/img/blog/wp/IMG_26042014_173617.png)</dt></dl><dl class='gallery-item col-3'><dt class='gallery-icon'>![Capture](/assets/img/blog/wp/Capture1.jpg)</dt></dl><dl class='gallery-item col-3'><dt class='gallery-icon'>![IMG_26042014_172813](/assets/img/blog/wp/IMG_26042014_172813.png)</dt></dl><dl class='gallery-item col-3'><dt class='gallery-icon'>![IMG_26042014_172612](/assets/img/blog/wp/IMG_26042014_172612.png)</dt></dl><dl class='gallery-item col-3'><dt class='gallery-icon'>![IMG_26042014_171921](/assets/img/blog/wp/IMG_26042014_171921.png)</dt></dl><dl class='gallery-item col-3'><dt class='gallery-icon'>![IMG_26042014_171648](/assets/img/blog/wp/IMG_26042014_171648.png)</dt></dl><dl class='gallery-item col-3'><dt class='gallery-icon'>![IMG_26042014_171605](/assets/img/blog/wp/IMG_26042014_171605.png)</dt></dl>
