A game heavily inspired by *Thomas Was Alone* â€“ this unnamed Unity project will probably not see much further development. Despite its unfinished state, it served as excellent practice, particularly for lighting and design.

I streamed the development of this game on Twitch in 2015, with viewer donations helping to fund the Amplify suite, including **Amplify Motion** and **Amplify Colors**. These tools allowed me to create some stunning visual effects and gave the game a polished, atmospheric look. I incorporated beautiful lighting setups, including volumetric 2D lights, which really made the environment pop.

Although the gameplay was simple, the puzzles basic, and the game ultimately unfinished, it was a valuable learning experience. The project helped me improve my skills in Unity, level design, and visual effects. It may not have seen full completion, but it was a great stepping stone in my development journey, and I ended up with some really pretty screenshots as a result.
