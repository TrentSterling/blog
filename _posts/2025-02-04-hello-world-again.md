# Hello World! Welcome to My New Dev Blog

Hello again! This is the first post on my freshly launched DevBlog, where I'll be backporting old blog entries and sharing new insights about game development, indie projects, and more.

## What's New?

- I'm transitioning from WordPress to Jekyll, which will allow for more control over the design, performance, and simplicity of the site.
- Expect to see a lot of content around game development, network programming, VR optimization, and the occasional post about my indie game projects.
- You might notice some gaps as I backport old blog posts, but I’ll be keeping it real with a fresh perspective on each one.

![My Awesome Bird]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image }})

Do you like my bird? It's one of my favorite images, symbolizing freedom in game design and development.

## What’s Next?

I’ll be working on a series of posts that detail:
- The process of migrating from WordPress to Jekyll.
- The challenges of optimizing VR performance for indie games.
- Building multiplayer systems with FishNet and Unity.
- And much more!

Stay tuned for updates, and let me know if you have any questions or ideas for posts!
