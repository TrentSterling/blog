*Monitoring performance!*

As you can see, I've used the UI library from [http://minimalcomps.com/](http://minimalcomps.com/)

Re-doing some of it, adding transparency and any other effects I see fit. Also, changes made from the options screen are **applied in real time**, so you can instantly see the impact of a certain option. No need to press 'apply' or anything! Instant results, *and* a pretty display!
