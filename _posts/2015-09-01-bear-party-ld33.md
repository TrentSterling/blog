My Ludum Dare 33 entry under the theme "You Are the Monster." Play as a giant bear, smashing buses and eating children.

I didn't want to directly tie this game to me because of how silly it was (which is absurd since you can see the entire thing being made on my Twitch account). But I couldn't get it out of my mind how bad the game was, or how much I wanted to distance myself from it.

I did technically finish the game with a main menu and game over screen, but IRL troubles kept me away from home for about a week after the jam ended.

The PC and Android versions were released as Patreon-exclusive builds.
