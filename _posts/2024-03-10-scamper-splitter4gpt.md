2024 brought two very different projects.

## Scamper

Multiplayer game project. Fast-paced, competitive, something about scampering around? The details are in my Discord somewhere. This one's still in development, carrying over into 2025.

Netcode is always the hard part. Using FishNet which has been solid, but syncing fast movement across the network is an eternal struggle.

## Splitter4GPT

A utility tool for working with GPT/LLM context windows. When you have large codebases or documents that exceed token limits, this helps split them intelligently.

Made it because I needed it. Open sourced it because why not. Sometimes the best tools come from scratching your own itch.

The AI tooling space moves so fast that this might already be obsolete by the time you read this. Such is life in 2024.
