Hey blog, forgot to mention this one.

Made a little horror game called **Humanity's Last Breath** for a game jam. It was dark, atmospheric, and probably too ambitious for the time limit. Classic jam experience.

Was deep in the Discord era at this point so I never properly documented it here. Oops.
