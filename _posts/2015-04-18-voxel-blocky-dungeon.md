No! The multiplayer archer game isn’t dead yet! But we have bigger and better fish to fry! Fancier fish with 3D voxels!

That’s right! We’re going back to Blocky Dungeon. However, as you can tell, we’re also going outside a bit!

The game is very much inspired by 3D Dot Game Heroes and has been put on a bit of a rapid release schedule – with plans for future versions with more content. For now, I just wanted to make sure any blog visitors knew I wasn’t dead!

## Development Reflection

{: .prompt-tip }
Inspired by the charm of *3D Dot Game Heroes*, I dove into Qubicle to craft detailed voxel models that bring every sword, enemy, and environment to life. The process was all about capturing that perfect blend of retro aesthetics with a modern 3D twist.

Back then, I set a rapid release schedule to keep the creative juices flowing—constantly testing new enemy designs, combat mechanics, and landscape ideas. Even though Blocky Dungeon never fully left the early development stage, it remains a memorable experiment in pushing the boundaries of voxel art and classic dungeon crawlers.
