Got really into VR dev in 2021. Quest 2 was out, standalone VR was finally viable, and I wanted to make stuff for it.

## Punchin' Duders

VR boxing/brawler thing. You punch dudes. They fall down. Simple satisfying gameplay loop.

Physics-based combat is SO satisfying in VR. There's nothing quite like connecting a solid punch and watching an enemy ragdoll.

## HackerPunk VR

Cyberpunk hacking game in VR. You'd jack into systems, navigate virtual spaces, avoid ICE, that kind of thing.

The aesthetic was cool - lots of neon grids and data streams. Gameplay needed more work but the vibe was there.

Both were Quest-focused since I wanted that standalone freedom. Tetherless VR is the way.
