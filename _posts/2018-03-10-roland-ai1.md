2018 was a weird year. Made a couple things, posted them to Discord, never wrote about them here.

## Roland

Physics-based character controller experiment. Ragdoll mechanics, procedural animation, that kind of thing.

## A.I.1

AI experiment. Was messing around with behavior trees and steering behaviors. The usual "I'll make smart NPCs" rabbit hole that every game dev falls into at some point.

Both projects taught me things. Neither shipped. Such is life.
