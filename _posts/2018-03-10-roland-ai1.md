2018 was a weird year. Made a couple things, posted them to Discord, never wrote about them here.

## Roland

Some kind of character controller experiment? Honestly the details are fuzzy. It involved physics and ragdolls I think.

## A.I.1

AI experiment. Was messing around with behavior trees and steering behaviors. The usual "I'll make smart NPCs" rabbit hole that every game dev falls into at some point.

Both projects taught me things. Neither shipped. Such is life.
