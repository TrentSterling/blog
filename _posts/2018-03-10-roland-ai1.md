2018 was a weird year. Made a couple things, posted them to Discord, never wrote about them here.

## Roland

Physics-based character controller experiment. Ragdoll mechanics, procedural animation, that kind of thing.

## A.I.1

This one wasn't mine - I wanted to document it anyway because I was slightly involved. A.I.1 was 99.9% the work of a friend I know as FomeDome. He was making a Descent/Metroidvania clone using Playmaker.

FomeDome was more artist than coder, which is why Playmaker was involved. At the time I was super into C# but also happened to be making Playmaker custom actions and felt I could help out. We both burned out though. Real life happens I guess.

Roland taught me things. A.I.1 taught me collaboration is hard. Neither shipped. Such is life.
