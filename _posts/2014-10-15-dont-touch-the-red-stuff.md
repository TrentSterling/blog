This is a simple 1 day platformer I made to get back into the habit of daily programming. Ive been slacking and getting rusty lately, so I’ve started to dive back into programming without my PlayMaker parachute/crutch. I still like PlayMaker, but there’s some things that just need to be coded straight.

I’ve also been wanting to start doing pixel art style 2d games. For 1 day of work, this might actually turn into a cool project at some point. There’s no sounds, the music is a royalty free thing, and there’s no animations, but the game is playable. If I had more than a day I’d add more to it. I want to make 1 game a day for a while, and possibly turn it into a week of polish for each of the 1day games when they’re complete. I haven’t decided yet.

There are only 3 levels right now because I am lazy and typically consider my self a bad level designer. If I had the time, I’d whip up a tile map editor and let the users create levels, but this is a 1 day project, and we can’t dedicate the time for that yet.
