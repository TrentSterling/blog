Hey blog, I made a farming game in VR.

**FarmVR** was my attempt at bringing that cozy farming sim genre into virtual reality. Plant crops, water them, harvest, sell, repeat. The satisfying loop that Stardew Valley perfected, but you're actually there doing it with your hands.

VR farming hits different. Actually reaching down to pull a carrot out of the ground, tossing it in a basket, wiping virtual sweat from your brow. It's weirdly meditative.

Never finished it to a releasable state but the core mechanics were solid. Maybe I'll revisit it someday. The Quest 3 has better passthrough for mixed reality farming...
