description: "Blog maintenance - condensing 70 articles down to 30."

Doing some general maintenance tonight. Took a lot of the short and meaningless blog posts down, and I'm grouping some topics together into single posts. Gotta get this place lookin' **classy**.

EDIT: Wow, I've gone from 70 articles to 30. I've condensed a few posts, and I plan to merge a few more. Everything is so much cleaner!
