I generally use [minimalcomps](http://minimalcomps.com/) for all my UI needs, and I've been tempted to look towards [ASwing](http://www.aswing.org/), but that's a bit bloated...

And then I came across [Razor Components](http://www.razorberry.com/blog/components/)! It's very lightweight and very sexy! Skinnable awesomeness.

I'm still probably going to stick with [minimalcomps](http://minimalcomps.com/) for my game, simply because it's already in there, but in the future I may move to this. It has one hell of a sexy color picker!
