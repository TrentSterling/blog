Ah yes, 2020. The year everyone was stuck inside. Perfect time for game dev, right?

## Heist And Jam

Multiplayer heist game prototype. Think Payday meets... something simpler. Was experimenting with netcode and cooperative gameplay for a Mix and Jam event (missed the deadline lol).

Survival horror on an island. Creepy atmosphere, definitely zombies involved.

Both projects were victims of scope creep and pandemic brain fog. 2020 was rough for everyone's productivity.
