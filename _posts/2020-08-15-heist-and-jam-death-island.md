Ah yes, 2020. The year everyone was stuck inside. Perfect time for game dev, right?

## Heist And Jam

Multiplayer heist game concept. Think Payday meets... something simpler. Was experimenting with netcode and cooperative gameplay.

The "jam" in the name was because it started as a game jam project. It grew beyond that but never quite reached a releasable state.

## Death Island

Survival horror thing. Island setting, creepy atmosphere, probably zombies involved. I was really into survival games at the time.

Both projects were victims of scope creep and pandemic brain fog. 2020 was rough for everyone's productivity.
