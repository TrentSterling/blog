Been playing around with different rendering engines. Each has their own set of features, and I'm not sure what I want to use.

Found a good list here: [AS3 Quick Guides - Open Source 3D Engines](http://matteley.wordpress.com/2009/10/11/as3-quick-guides-open-source-3d-engines/)

Now that Alternativa has been released, I'll probably try it out. My project currently uses Papervision3D, and I was planning on moving to the much smaller ND3D, but it's missing some essential features (UV tiling, multiple viewport layers).

I might also try out Away3D Lite, seeing as it gives good performance, has the features I need, and it's not TOO much different than Papervision. Going to do some performance tests because rendering speed is all that matters!
