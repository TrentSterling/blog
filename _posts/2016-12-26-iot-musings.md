IoT is the Wild West. Standards and frameworks are being developed by big companies - and adoption will determine the winner.

My goal in researching IoT was pretty simple. Wifi Toast. An RGB lightbulb. A keyfinder. A security system. Most of your typical IoT Hello World type projects.

But this opened my eyes to Microcontrollers vs Microprocessors, signal processing, electromagnetism, and the speed of light. Analog still has some uses too.

Honestly, I think I want to focus on robotics. Until I can afford more stepper motors and servos, I'll have to keep the human element in my projects.

Tony Stark made an Iron Man suit with a box of scraps! In a cave!

Sure, it's a movie - but these days - you could imagine such a thing being reality.

Augmented Reality gives you a HUD. Sensitive microphone? Magic ears. RF communications. Eyes in the back of your head via camera. Got internet? Now you can see every camera in your house - or around the world.

Multiple sensor nodes? An ear in every device.

Did I mention that LEDs make everything look pretty?

You're a few weapons away from being a super hero now. Maybe you can't fly, but you can hear all, see all, and taser the shit out of any combatants.

Not good enough? Buy a gun this is fucking America.

Oh, and that drone following you? He's just following your GPS waypoints with a few other inputs to make the experience a bit smoother. He's also recording everything so you can upload your own bad-ass-super-hero movie to YouTube after you go around the yard posing for weird cosplay selfies.

Your toast is done, sir.
