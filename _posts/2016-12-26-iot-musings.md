IoT is the Wild West. Standards and frameworks are being developed by big companies - and adoption will determine the winner.

## Initial Goals

My goal in researching IoT was pretty simple:
- Wifi Toast
- An RGB lightbulb
- A keyfinder
- A security system

Most of your typical IoT "Hello World" type projects.

## What It Opened Up

But this opened my eyes to:
- Microcontrollers vs Microprocessors
- Signal processing
- Electromagnetism
- The speed of light

Analog still has some uses too.

## Future Direction

Honestly, I think I want to focus on **robotics**. Until I can afford more stepper motors and servos, I'll have to keep the human element in my projects.
