+[Andrew Sandifer](https://plus.google.com/113965841856705384373) challenged me and +[Yuuki Rus ](https://plus.google.com/104512160836330627208/posts)to a Christmas Game Jam, which kinda turned into a New Years Game Jam, because that’s how stuff works.

The idea was that we’d have 1 day to complete game 1. 2 days to complete game 2, and so on until New Years.

This was our 1-day game, which has had 3 days of off and on development put into it because RULES DON’T OWN ME.

I’ll be releasing it soon. I want to say tonight but real life won’t stop getting in the way. I have 2-3 more games to do before New Years, and I’ll be recording development.

Right now I have something like 14 hours of footage, and none of it seems interesting to me. I’ll probably speed it up 20x and just do a timelapse, even though that seems even LESS interesting.

I should mention that the game is some kind of mix between Sonic, Contra, and generic robots.

Update: Still need to fix UI. I haven’t eaten all day and I’m tired. Here’s another gif – with sexy dance added bonus!
