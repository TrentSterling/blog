More Discord-era projects that never got proper blog posts.

## RigidbodyDuder

Physics-based character controller. The idea was to have a character that's entirely driven by rigidbody physics - no kinematic cheating. Walking, jumping, ragdolling, all physics-based.

It was janky as hell but also hilarious. The character would flop around like a drunk marionette.

## LoopStuck

An INCOMPLETE game for workingclassduck's gamejam. Ran out of time and probably won't finish it.

[Play it on itch.io](https://trent.itch.io/loopstuck)

Time loop puzzle game concept. You'd repeat the same short time period over and over, learning patterns and solving puzzles. Think Outer Wilds but way smaller scope.

Never finished it but the core loop (heh) was fun to prototype.
