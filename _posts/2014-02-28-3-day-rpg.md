A bunch of us devs decided to make life harder by compounding multiple layers of gamejams at one moment. Besides crunch from [OneGameAMonth](http://www.onegameamonth.com/) I now have to finish an RPG in 3 days. I'd like to thank [TheVillageBlacksmith](http://www.thevillageblacksmith.net/) for getting me involved in such a crazy plan. Worst case scenario, at least I have something for OneGameAMonth.

It's all very early stuff that probably won't get finished, but at least it's good practice. Who knows though. Maybe I'll find an artist to do it up right? And check out DAT CAPE!

I don't know what rules were in place or if everything was supposed to be from scratch, but I'm the only one using Unity so I feel that I have to prove something to everyone.
