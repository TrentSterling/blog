This is by far the most snow I've ever seen in my life. I know for some people up north it's nothing, but I'm from Oklahoma, where all we get is tornados.

*So fluffy!*

![Yeah, that car won't be moving for a while.](/assets/img/blog/my_car_lol.jpg){: .align-center }
*Yeah, that car won't be moving for a while.*

So anyway, I figured I'd share the snow with you all. Back to programming.

EDIT: After a few days I got the car out of the snow. The roads are still slick, but at least I won't starve!
