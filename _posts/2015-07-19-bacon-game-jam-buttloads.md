## What is Bacon Game Jam?

Bacon Game Jam is a 48-hour Reddit community-powered game jam. The rules are fairly relaxed, and it’s always a fun time.

## Watch the Game Get Made!

I streamed the entire development process on Twitch.

## About BUTTLOADS!

BUTTLOADS! was heavily inspired by *Motherlode*—you dig, upgrade, and descend into chaos.

The code was a mess, and I wasted a lot of time trying to get it working on Android. In the last six hours, I scrapped the Android port in favor of dynamic shadows and better controls.

My artist got sick, so I used some art from viewers. After the jam, I planned to clean up the game, fix bugs, and eventually finish the Android port.
