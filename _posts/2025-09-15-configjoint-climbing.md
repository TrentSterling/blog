Physics-based climbing experiment using Unity's ConfigJoint system.

{% include youtube.html id="3_x33cRPl9E" %}

The idea was to create climbing that felt weighty and physical - not just canned animations snapping to ledges, but actual limbs reaching, gripping, and pulling.

ConfigJoints let you define complex constraints between rigidbodies. Perfect for something like this where you need arms that can reach and grab but still obey physics.

Another prototype exploring joint-based character systems and procedural animation.
