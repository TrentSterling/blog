2025 started with a bang. Or more accurately, with a LOT of rapid prototypes.

## BoostMelon

![BoostMelon](/assets/img/blog/boostmelon.jpg){: .align-center }

Multiplayer racing game. Boost pads, melons (don't ask), chaos. Using FishNet for netcode because at this point I've built enough multiplayer stuff to know what works.

Still in active development. The core loop is fun - that "just one more race" feeling.

## The Vibe Projects

I went absolutely ham with AI-assisted prototyping. Gemini 2.5 Pro in particular let me bang out concepts at ridiculous speed:

- **VibeBounce** - Physics platformer
- **VibeCar** - Driving thing
- **VibeCraft** - Building blocks
- **VibeStar** - Space combat
- **vibesand** - Falling sand simulation
- **vibewater** - Fluid dynamics
- **vibeduders** - Character AI experiments
- **vibevoxelprobes** - Voxel rendering tech
- **vibebeats** - Rhythm game prototype
- **vibeprime** - Prime number visualization (???)
- And like 10 more...

Most are tiny experiments, not full games. But the speed of iteration is insane. Ideas that would have taken a week to prototype now take an afternoon.

The future of game dev is weird and I'm here for it.
