I had an old friend on steam recently ask about my old Garry’s Mod lua scripts. He asked if I still had them. This wasn’t the first time he had asked me, and in the past, I told him that I might get back into Garry’s Mod, and rewrite the scripts myself into a nice gamemode. That was years ago, so when he asked me again recently, I decided to say screw it, and upload the old scripts to github.
## Released Source Code

Vaultscript, KittyScript, and LiteScript were some of the first bits of code I had ever written. TONS of it is copied from tutorials, and gamemodes like DarkRP. They’re horrible and shouldn’t be used for anything more than a shitty reference at what I was trying to do back then. They’re unorganized, and some even have copies of directories inside because I wasn’t sure which version was the latest. I highly doubt they’ll do anything but vomit errors in the current version of Garry’s Mod. These were written in 2009.

I have a lot of nostalgia looking back at Garry’s Mod. I can’t say any game has ever come close to being as great to me. The entire reason I became a game developer was because of Garry’s Mod.
