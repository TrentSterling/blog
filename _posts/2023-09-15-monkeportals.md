**MonkePortals** is my ongoing VR project. Think Gorilla Tag movement meets voxel building meets portal mechanics.

The core idea: you're a monkey (or monkey-like creature) swinging through procedural voxel worlds, using portals to navigate and manipulate the environment.

## What's Working

- Gorilla Tag style arm-based locomotion (no joystick movement, pure arm swinging)
- Voxel terrain generation
- Portal gun mechanics
- Quest standalone performance (this was HARD)

## What's Not Done

- Multiplayer (using FishNet, need to optimize for Quest)
- Level editor
- Actual game loop beyond "swing around and place portals"

Still actively working on this one. It's the project that keeps pulling me back.
