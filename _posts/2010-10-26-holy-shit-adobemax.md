Codenamed project Molehill, Adobe showed off the new 3d rendering capabilities in flash. It's console quality graphics! Now I have to finish off my papervision game before this gets released!

Here's a preview of the new player with a game set up by the guys at [Alternativa](http://blog.alternativaplatform.com/en/).

With new technology coming to flash in 2011, I have to finish my papervision3d game ASAP. I printed out an hourly schedule and taped it to my door so that I can get my game out as soon as possible, and still keep myself showered and fed. I also printed out a list of goals, with my game being on top.
