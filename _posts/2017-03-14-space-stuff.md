It's PI Day!

So here's a link to this crazy space game I did.

## The Game

**7DaySpaceJam** - A space simulation game created as part of a 7-day challenge/bet.

Made this as a personal challenge to see how much of a space game I could build in just one week. Features galactic exploration, ship systems, and the vastness of space.

Pretty neat huh?
