I forgot to post this here. I made a little timelapse of me making a spaceship model. Its not a very good model but hey, its a neat video. I was planning to make a lot more videos but I've been having a lot of interruptions at home. My in-laws are visiting soon so don't expect to hear much from me for a while.
