In an effort to keep track of development—and to make sure that I am always moving forward with progress—I’ve decided to open up my development in a bit of a public way. It should help keep motivation going. And if I start to slack off, hopefully the shame it brings will kick my ass into working harder.

Public humiliation can be so motivational!!!
