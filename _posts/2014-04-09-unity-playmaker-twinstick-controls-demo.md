This is a simple twin stick shooter setup for PlayMaker. I’m hoping to get a bunch of these prototype game mechanics into
 a set of tutorials. I’m still working on the style of my channel, and it’s taking me a while to get things feeling ‘right’.

I also have a bunch of custom PlayMaker actions that I’m hoping to release. I figure a tutorial for each would be a good
 way to release them. Pain in the ass things like integrating with pathfinding, outputting frames per second, getting raw
 controller input, and some better vector modification actions are some of my most used.
 This is also a quality test to see how Youtube handles my HandBrake settings.

Sorry there’s no sound in this. I skipped editing and uploaded it ‘raw’.
