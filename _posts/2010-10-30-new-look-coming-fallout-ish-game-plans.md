Gonna pretty up the blog soon. It's too bland.

I've been getting a lot of comments and messages about VaultScript, my GMod gamemode that was abandoned when I moved to rural Missouri. Since then I've switched to flash games to pay the bills. Now that true 3d is coming to flash, and there's multiplayer support either through playerIO, or possibly the new P2P system, I'm thinking about making a fallout based MMO. Of course, I'd probably end up getting sued, so we're going to call it... Something else.

I also found a beautiful solution to shading/shadows here: [http://kode80.com/2009/09/28/papervision-ssao-phase-ii/](http://kode80.com/2009/09/28/papervision-ssao-phase-ii/)
