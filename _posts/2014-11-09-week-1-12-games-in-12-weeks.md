# Wow, what a week!

How to even begin? Well for starters, I guess I’ll mention that gamedev is hard. Scheduling is hard. Finishing stuff is hard.
# What went right?

I started streaming my daily development on twitch.

My internet speed isnt the greatest, so the actual visual quality is kinda poor. But the experience is great! Lot’s of people came to watch my stream. **I got 71 followers in a single week! **

So it’s going well. Part of the reason I think people are interested in the steam is not the 12 games goal, but that I decided to make my first game for this challenge into a **networked multiplayer game.**

# Trent! That’s freakin’ crazy you idiot!

I know. It was more of a joke, as the game was initially made for local multiplayer only. But the controller stuff I used to hook up 4 controllers was not working for everyone testing. So we nuked it and went back to the Unity defaults. People kept requesting online multiplayer, so I said sure, let’s give it a shot.
# What went wrong?

Multiplayer has eaten 4 days of the development, so the game didn’t get completed. Here I am at day 8, where I’m supposed to switch to a new game or else I won’t be following the rules I posted.

But everyone who’s watching seems to think my current project is fun. I had more than 30+ viewers at once, which was really cool to see everyone join the server and screw around! I don’t know what to do with week 2.

Also, Unity 4.6 broke! I ignored the beta warnings because the 4.6 UI was so nice.

**I SHOULD HAVE LISTENED!**

Basically they screwed anything I built with 4.6 in a webplayer update. My baconjam entry, Super Turbo Ship Puncher 3 is totally busted now.

To make matters worse, the projects don’t downgrade easily. You lose your scenes, but keep prefabs and scripts. It sucks.

The downgrade on the coop networked archer game took an entire day to fix.

I’m not entirely sure what I’ll be doing for Week 2. I want to keep working on my Multiplayer Coop Archer game, as it got me a lot of viewers/attention. But I want to make 12 games in 12 weeks. I guess I’ll have to ask the audience.

# Play it!

I have a dedicated server running. Sometimes it goes down when I’m updating stuff. But yeah, check it out!
