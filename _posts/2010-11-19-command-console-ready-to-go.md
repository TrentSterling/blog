Been working hard on my game. Recently broke the renderer, but hey, at least I have a fully functional console now!

*You can also see my radial menu in the back there. Eventually everything will fall into place!*

I know it isn't much, but things have been moving slowly for me. Here's a picture!

*Progress!*

I've got culling and whatnot to work, and things seem to run pretty smoothly, until I go over 1000 triangles. Additionally, I'll have to look deeper into my culling code, because I've been noticing small dips in framerate when I have 1000s of objects off-screen. Perhaps I need to throw culled entities into their own array or find some other way to optimize everything. I'll figure it out eventually!

Oh, and here's my FGL icon for Dynamite Max. I know this is something I should probably do later, but oh well!

**Classy!**
