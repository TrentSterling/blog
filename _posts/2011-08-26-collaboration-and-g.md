So what have I been doing lately? Other than working on my overcomplicated game that I fear will never get finished, I've been collaborating with [The Village Blacksmith](http://www.thevillageblacksmith.net/) on a nameless game that he started.

*For now it's being referred to as 'That Game'*

I've been massaging Nape into the gameplay, and I've been throwing in different things like enemies and cutscenes.

Been doing a lot of talking on G+. It has completely replaced my Facebook and Twitter, although I'll check those occasionally. It's just a better tool. There's no other way to explain it.

I find that it's a great place to find an audience and start a conversation. If you like my blog, than you should probably add me on G+. Add me to your circles, +1 some posts, whatever!
