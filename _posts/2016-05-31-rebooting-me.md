## The Problem

Woops! My bad!

So it turns out that leaving the internet for MONTHS is not a great choice for someone who relies on donations from people who watch daily streams!

Content hungry viewers will look elsewhere if you abandon them. Seems like common sense I guess?

## The Lesson

Beyond a bunch of personal issues, the key takeaway is: if you want to build an audience and maintain support, you have to be **consistent** and **present**.

Sometimes life gets in the way, and that's okay. But understanding that your audience won't wait forever is an important reality check for any content creator.
