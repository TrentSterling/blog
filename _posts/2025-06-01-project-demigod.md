**Project Demigod** is the current main project. Can't say too much yet but here's the elevator pitch:

VR action game where you feel like a god. Powers, combat, destruction. The kind of power fantasy that VR does better than any other medium.

## What I Can Share

- Unity + FishNet for multiplayer
- Quest standalone (with PC VR support)
- Physics-based combat (learned a lot from Punchin' Duders)
- Destructible environments

## What I Can't Share Yet

The rest. Stay tuned.

This is the project that all the experiments and prototypes have been building towards. All those years of netcode struggles, VR jank, physics systems - they're all paying off now.

More updates coming when there's more to show.
