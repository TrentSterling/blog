I'm not sure that I'll always have something that's awesome to read about, or that I'll even be able to make posts daily, but I'll try. I figure it shouldn't be too hard, seeing as I check FGL, Gmail, Twitter, Facebook - and every other service hourly.

As far as the game goes, I've just changed the minimalcomps color chooser to use this batch of swatches stolen from Flash CS4.

Anyway, as soon as I get the rest of the User Interface working, and get it all linked to the editor functions, I'll be in business. Wish me luck!
