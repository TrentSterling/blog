*UI Colors*

I changed a few colors and tried to give all of the editor controls a more unified look. Changing the parameters in the editor will make changes to the current object in real time. This will make previewing changes much easier. I also added more camera controls on left. Originally I wasn't going to include them, but my wife says she'd be more likely to use the UI controls rather than using the keyboard.

I guess it IS supposed to be geared towards **casual players**, so it's good to have a casual gamer wife to point me in the right direction. I'm also thinking about scrapping the WASD+Mouse for a simpler control style. It would also allow me to make it a 2-player on the same screen sorta game, which me and the wife can really enjoy after setting up [XPadder](http://www.xpadder.com/). Playing flash games with an Xbox 360 controller is pretty fun!

Anyway, I feel that I'm spending too much time blogging about game development and not spending enough time actually developing anything. I'll probably make another post before I go to bed if I accomplish anything awesome, but don't get your hopes up. **Back to slaving over a hot keyboard!**
