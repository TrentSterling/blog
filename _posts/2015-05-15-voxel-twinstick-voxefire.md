VoxeFire (or VoxaFire) is a voxel-powered twin-stick shooter made specifically to run on Amazon's FireTV device.

## Performance

Performance has been a roller coaster - while some things are surprisingly speedy, other things are laggy and stuttery.

## Features

- Entire arena/game map is destructible
- Artwork is all voxel-based
- Designed for FireTV controller input
