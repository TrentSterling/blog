Came across the BulletFlash project, which doesn't have a lot of talk around it yet. The project is an alchemy port of the [Bullet Physics](http://www.bulletphysics.com/) engine. After looking at the trunk on their [googlecode](http://code.google.com/p/bulletflash/) project page, I found a working build!

The performance with stacking seems to surpass [JigLibFlash](http://www.jiglibflash.com/), so maybe it's possible to see some decent physics in Flash!
