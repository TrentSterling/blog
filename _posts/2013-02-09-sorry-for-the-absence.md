I've been away from the internet for a very long time, as you may or may not have noticed. I've done a bit of prototyping while I was gone, and played with Unity and UDK a bit. Unity is very interesting, and depending on how the flash market goes, may be the next option for me to make games. Anyway, now that I'm in contact with [Andrew Sandifer (The Village Blacksmith)](http://www.thevillageblacksmith.net/) I'll be finishing up The Dummy Game. Here's a pic or two... or 4.

EDIT: Or 5. What, you expect me to be able to count?
