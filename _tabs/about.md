# About Trent Sterling

Welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm **Trent Sterling**, a passionate game developer with nearly a decade of experience creating games, systems, and tools. I specialize in Unity, C#, multiplayer networking, VR optimization, and procedural generation, but I have a vast range of skills that help me tackle a variety of development challenges. From game mechanics to application development, I’ve done it all.

## My Focus Areas

- **Unity & C#** – Creating robust systems for gameplay, AI, and multiplayer networks. I build efficient, high-performance systems and push Unity's capabilities to their limits.
- **Shaders & Procedural Generation** – Focusing on generating dynamic worlds and creating custom shaders that maximize visual fidelity and performance, particularly in VR environments.
- **VR Optimization** – Ensuring seamless, high-quality VR experiences that run at 120Hz or higher to provide smooth and immersive interactions.
- **Multiplayer Systems** – Building scalable and cross-platform multiplayer systems with a keen focus on reducing latency and optimizing network traffic, including crossplay between PC, Android, and Oculus Quest.
- **NodeJS & Web Development** – I’m diving back into the web world after years of focusing on game dev. Expect some fancy JavaScript magic, particularly around NodeJS, Phaser, and IoT (Internet of Things) integration.

## My Background

I’ve been working in the world of game development for nearly 10 years, and during that time, I’ve picked up a wide range of skills across different fields. I started with modding **Halo CE/2**, creating custom maps, and diving into **Minecraft** mods and **Garry’s Mod** gamemodes. These experiences gave me a deep understanding of game mechanics, scripting, and community-driven development.

As I grew, I moved into **indie game development** and began focusing on multiplayer games, especially around **VR performance optimization**. I developed a particular interest in **network traffic optimization**, working to ensure multiplayer games run smoothly without hiccups, even with complex mechanics or large numbers of players.

I also have experience in **machine learning demos**, **IoT (Internet of Things)**, and **home automation**, and I’m always experimenting with new tech to expand my knowledge and improve my projects.

## Random Skills

While my main focus is game development, I’ve had my hands in many other areas over the years, including:

- **Videography** – Making videos for devlogs, tutorials, and game trailers.
- **Web Design** – Designing websites for projects and portfolios, especially focusing on user experience (UX) and minimalism.
- **3D Modeling** – Using Blender and other tools for asset creation and optimization.
- **Photoshop** – Graphics creation, texture design, and visual assets for games.

## My Projects & Links

I’ve worked on a variety of interesting and diverse projects, some of which you can explore below. These include games, tools, and experimental demos:

- **[MonkePortals](https://monke.tront.xyz)** – A quirky VR game with unique mechanics.
- **[HackerPunk](https://punk.tront.xyz)** – A fast-paced, hacker-themed game.
- **[Splitter4GPT](https://trentsterling.github.io/splitter/)** – A tool for generating and splitting data using GPT.
- **[3D Dungeon Generator](https://3ddungeon.tront.xyz)** – A procedural dungeon generator for 3D games.
- **[Home Automation & IoT](https://iot.tront.xyz)** – A blog on my IoT projects and home automation experiments.
- **[Machine Learning Demos](https://ml.tront.xyz)** – Demos showcasing machine learning algorithms and models.
- **[Weird Phaser Stuff](https://phaser.tront.xyz)** – My experiments with Phaser.js and 2D web games.

## Why This Blog?

This blog is a way for me to share everything I’m working on, my thoughts on game development, tutorials, and behind-the-scenes looks at the projects I’m developing. It's a place to document my journey, share knowledge, and hopefully help others in the game development community.

I also use this blog to backport content from my **[old blog](http://trentsterling.com/blog)** and share insights that are useful for indie developers, especially those working with **multiplayer networking**, **VR**, and **game optimization**. Expect deep dives, tips, and advice based on my decade of experience.
