{: .prompt-tip }


Welcome! I’m **Trent Sterling**, a game developer with over a decade of experience. I specialize in Unity, C#, multiplayer networking, VR optimization, and procedural generation, but I’m versatile across many development areas.


## My Focus Areas

- **Unity & C#** – Creating high-performance systems for gameplay, AI, and multiplayer.
- **Shaders & Procedural Generation** – Designing dynamic worlds and custom shaders, particularly for VR.
- **VR Optimization** – Ensuring smooth, immersive VR experiences at 120Hz+.
- **Multiplayer Systems** – Building scalable cross-platform multiplayer with optimized network traffic, including crossplay between PC, Android, and Oculus Quest.
- **NodeJS & Web Development** – Back into web dev with a focus on NodeJS, Phaser, and IoT integration.

## My Background

I started with **Halo CE/2** modding and later worked on **Minecraft** mods and **Garry’s Mod** gamemodes. These early experiences taught me game mechanics, scripting, and community-driven development.

I’ve since focused on **indie game development** and **multiplayer games**, especially **VR performance optimization** and **network traffic optimization** for smoother gameplay.

I’ve also explored **machine learning**, **IoT**, and **home automation**, constantly expanding my skill set.

## Random Skills

While my main focus is game development, I’ve had my hands in many other areas over the years, including:

- **Videography** – Creating devlogs, tutorials, and trailers.
- **Web Design** – Building minimalist, user-friendly sites.
- **3D Modeling** – Asset creation and optimization using Blender.
- **Photoshop** – Graphics, textures, and visual assets for games.

## Why This Blog?

This blog is a way for me to share everything I’m working on, my thoughts on game development, tutorials, and behind-the-scenes looks at the projects I’m developing. It's a place to document my journey, share knowledge, and hopefully help others in the game development community.

I also use this blog to backport content from my **[old blog](http://old.trentsterling.com/)** and share insights that are useful for indie developers, especially those working with **multiplayer networking**, **VR**, and **game optimization**. Expect deep dives, tips, and advice based on my decade of experience.
